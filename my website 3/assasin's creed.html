        <div class="des"><p>In the first installment of Assassin’s Creed, Desmond Miles voiced by Nolan North wakes up in a 
            laboratory inside the Animus, which is a machine that allows him to relive the memories of his ancestor. He confronts the
             man responsible for bringing him to the Animus, only to be blackmailed by Vidic (Phil Proctor) for information only obtained by reliving the life of Altair.</p>
        <p>When Desmond enters the Animus, he begins Altair’s story of retrieving the golden orb. When he fails his mission, his 
            rank and weapons are taken from him. In order to reclaim his original title, he is sent on a mission to assassinate nine 
            members of the Templar organization. Along the way, Altair must also collect data on each of the targets and report back.</p>
    <p>Desmond is allowed some rest in between the trails of Altair, where he becomes immensely close with Dr. Vidic’s assistant,
         Lucy Stillman who is voiced by Kristen Bell. In these brief breaks, Desmond learns about modern-day Templars and what they are after.</p></div>

<p>You would think that Desmond dying would be the end of Absergo using him for information about his ancestors, but it is not. They take samples from Desmond’s corpse that allow them to continue searching his memories using the Animus’ cloud computing abilities. Absergo then hires someone that can look into the memories
     and relive the life of Edward Kenway.</p>
<p>Edward Kenway was an 18th century pirate and grandfather of Conner from the previous game. He uncovers a plot between Templars in the British and Spanish empires. They tend to use their positions of power to pinpoint the Sage. The Sage is the only person that can lead them to the Observatory
    , which is a First Civilization device that can be used to spy on anyone anywhere.</p>
<p>By accidentally killing Duncan, Edward is thrust into the Templar-Assassin society.</p>
